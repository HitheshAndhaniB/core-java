1.java is an object oriented programming laguage,
  javac is an compiler it is compile the .java file in the compiler.

2.jdk-java development kit.
  JRE-java runtime environment.
   jvm-java vertual machine.

3.java file- java file is an main  file in java programming ,in this file contains source code.
  class file- class file is an compiled file, in this file contains byte code,source code is converted into bytecode.

4.java IDE'S- JDK,JVM,JRE.

5.variables - variables is used to store the values.
  types of variables-
        1.local variables.
	2.static variables.
	3.Non-static variables.

  example:1.int usn;
          2.  class student{
                 static int usn;
		 static String name;
		}
	3.class student{
                 static int usn;
		 static String name;
		}

6.object oriented programming in java- java is an object oriented programming language, in java program cantains class and objects,
   class is cantains objects and diffrent methods.


7.compiled succefully.
 error is no return statment,


8.data type-data type is used to store the value for variable.

primitive data type:-int,float,char,double,long
	example:int num;
	    Non primitive data type :-array,graph.
	example : shape trianle;

9.Dot operator:- Dot operator is used to initialize the value from the variables.

10.Features of java:-
 	object oriented programming
	speed 
	multi tasking
	rubost and secure
        platforme independent

11.Array - Array is an collection of elements,in size is fixed con't be changed,elements are accessed in array using index.
	example:-int[] age;
          
12.class and object:-
	class is an temlate in java class can have diffent objects and methods.
	class is an keyword in java 
	example:- class world{

		}

	objects:- In java object is an real world entity it have state and behaviors.
        example:- class student{
                  int usn;
		  String address;
			}

13.keywords:- In java there are 49 keywords are ther, keywords are reserved words it can not changes,in java keywords are not take as variables and methods.
             example:- class,new,abstract,int,float,char,break,switch,else,for,if,return.


14.constructor:- Constructors is an special method in java,
 		 it as no return type,
		 same name as a class name,
		 constructors is used to initialize variable.
     types:-1.default constructors,
	    2.parametarized constructors,

15.main method is static becouse it is not acceable any we declare the method as static,



16.class xworkz{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int[] num={12,3,2,45,6,7,6};
		int n=num.length;
		System.out.println("total length of the array is:"+n);
	}

17.method and method overloading:-
	method:-In java method is an collection of methods,in method we can invoking  the method.

	example:-class student{ 
		String name;
		int age;
                
 		public static void main(String[] args){	
		System.out.println("stdent name :"+name);
		System.out.println("student age :"+age);
		}
		}

	method overloding:-in java same method having diffent parameter is called method overloading.

        example:-class student{
		String name;
		int age;
		String address;
		
		public static void main(String[] args){

		void details(String name){
		System.out.println("String name"+name);
		}

		void details(String name,int age){
		System.out.println("String name"+name);
		System.out.println("Student age"+age);
		}
		}
